# mineflayer-bot-typescript
A template for mineflayer Minecraft bot written in TypeScript. FYI Mineflayer is fully typed, so everything is pretty straight-forward. 

### Why?
I had found examples only written either in plain JS or Python, which are both, let's be honest, big trash.
So i've made this template to save some of your precious time.

## Run and Build
I prefer using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) instead of `Yarn` or `npm`. so:
- To run the project in your dev environment, use: `pnpm run dev`
- To build and start: `pnpm run build` & `pnpm run start` respectively
